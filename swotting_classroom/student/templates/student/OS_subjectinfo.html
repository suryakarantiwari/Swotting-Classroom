        <h3> An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system
            is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process
            management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
            Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, OS/400, AIX,
            z/OS, etc.
